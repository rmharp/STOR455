# Final Project README

## Overview
This repository contains the R code and associated files for the "Final Project" for STOR 455. The project focuses on analyzing socio-economic indicators to explore their predictive power on annual income, contributing to a broader understanding of poverty and its multifaceted impact on society.

## Project Description
The project involves extensive data cleaning and analysis of datasets obtained from Telamon, focusing on indicators of well-being, family data, and priorities. It aims to identify significant predictors of annual income and understand the socio-economic conditions affecting families, particularly in Cabarrus County.

## Data Sources
The data used in this project are sourced from the following GitHub repository: `https://github.com/rmharp/STOR455` and include:
- Indicators Data
- Families Data
- Priorities Data (excluded from analysis)

## Installation and Dependencies
The project requires R and several R packages for data manipulation, visualization, and analysis. Ensure the following packages are installed and loaded:
- `tidyverse`
- `formattable`
- `ggplot2`
- `gganimate`
- `regclass`
- `car`

Use the provided R script to install any missing packages automatically.

## Usage
1. Clone or download this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the R Markdown file (`Final Project.Rmd`) in an R-compatible IDE (e.g., RStudio).
3. Run the code chunks sequentially to reproduce the analysis and generate the report.

## Key Findings
- The project explores the relationship between socio-economic indicators and annual income.
- A comprehensive data cleaning process was conducted to ensure data quality.
- Linear models were used to attempt predicting annual income based on various indicators, highlighting the complex nature of socio-economic factors influencing income levels.

## Contributions
This project was developed as part of the coursework for STOR 455 at UNC-Chapel Hill, under the guidance of the course instructor and contributions from fellow students.
